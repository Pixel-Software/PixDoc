# MaterialDoxygen

Formatting files for Voxel's doxygen documentation generation. Using the
additional files provided here as the extra files which can be supplied to
Doxygen will produce documentation which is based on Google's material design.

The __stylesheet.css__ is generated from the __scss__ files in the
[Voxel documentation respository](https://github.com/Voxelated/voxelated.github.io) -- see the **_sass** directory, and the README for how to
compile the sass files into a css file. By changing the variables in the
sass files, and replacing the **stylesheet.css** file in this repository with
the compiled modified scss files, custom looking Doxygen based on Google's
material theme can be produced.
